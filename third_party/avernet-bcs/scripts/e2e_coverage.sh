# BCS e2e line-coverage orchestration script (bcs-only, ported and trimmed
# from ocb).
# Flow: singlebox --with-bcs-coverage start bcs_bots -> e2e.sh -> SIGTERM bcs
#       (flush profraw) -> singlebox stop bcs_bots -> cargo llvm-cov report
#       --cobertura / text / --summary-only --json -> e2e_cov_gate.py.
#
# Gate semantics:
#   - e2e is always a 100% gate (no switch): any e2e failure makes the script
#     exit with the non-zero e2e exit code.
#   - Line and method coverage thresholds default to 0 (collect + report only).
#     Pass --bcs-line-min / --bcs-method-min to gate them independently.
#     --bcs-min remains as a compatibility shortcut that sets both thresholds.
#     Region coverage is reported but NOT gated. Emits GitHub
#     ::notice::/::error:: annotations (local: OK/FAIL) for each metric.
#   - Adapter HTTP endpoint coverage is always gated at 100%.
#   - bcs-cli leaf-command coverage is always gated at 100%.
#   - The gates are independent and can fail the run: e2e failure takes
#     precedence, followed by endpoint/CLI coverage, then line/method coverage.
#
# Usage:
#   bash src/bcs/scripts/e2e_coverage.sh              # full flow
#   bash src/bcs/scripts/e2e_coverage.sh --skip-start # instrumented bcs already running; run e2e + stop + aggregate only
#   bash src/bcs/scripts/e2e_coverage.sh --no-stop    # do not stop bcs after running (debug; no aggregation)
#   bash src/bcs/scripts/e2e_coverage.sh --bcs-line-min 40 --bcs-method-min 36
#                                                    # gate line >=40%, method >=36%
#   bash src/bcs/scripts/e2e_coverage.sh --force-rebuild # force-rebuild instrumented bcs (ignore cache)
