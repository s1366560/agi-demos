# BCN OpenAPI V1 Review Follow-up Reliability Design

## Goal

Resolve the five actionable review findings added after commit `591810e7`
without changing Legacy API behavior or mounting the V1 production router
before a signed Gateway Principal verifier exists.

## Scope

This follow-up covers:

1. Propagating session-membership query failures to V1 callers.
2. Propagating friendship query failures during V1 eligibility checks.
3. Propagating persistent session deletion failures during runtime cleanup.
4. Rejecting duplicate participant Actor IDs before group canonicalization.
5. Declaring the existing `non_public_participant` create conflict in OpenAPI.

Production router mounting remains deferred. The existing unresolved thread
stays open until bootstrap can inject the real signed Principal verifier.

### Runtime linkage and coverage boundary

The V1 Group facade lives in the dedicated `bcs-group-v1` service crate.
Workspace unit and contract tests compile that crate, but the production
`bcs` composition root does not depend on it while the V1 router is unmounted.
This keeps runtime E2E coverage scoped to code that the deployed binary can
actually execute. When the signed Principal verifier is available, the
production mounting change must add both `bcs-group-v1` and `bcs-api-http` to
the composition root and add live V1 Singlebox stories in the same change.

## Architecture

### Backward-compatible fallible companions

Legacy core and repository methods currently return `bool` or `Vec<T>` and
convert storage failures into negative or empty results. Changing those
signatures would affect existing callers and violate the compatibility goal.

Instead, the relevant Service API contracts gain fallible companion methods:

- `FriendCoreService::try_are_friends(...) -> ServiceResult<bool>`
- `SessionRepoPort::try_list_group_ids_by_session_participant(...)`
  `-> ServiceResult<Vec<String>>`

Default implementations delegate to the existing infallible methods so test
doubles and Legacy implementations keep compiling. The database-backed
implementations override the companions and propagate query and row-decoding
failures. V1 application paths use only the fallible companions.

### Session deletion

`MySqlSessionStore::delete` must return a `ServiceError` when either the
participant-side-table delete or the session-row delete fails. Successful
deletion remains idempotent and returns whether the session row existed.
Runtime cleanup already propagates `SessionManagementService::delete` errors,
so fixing the repository result prevents Group/runtime state from reporting
successful deletion after a persistence failure.

### Participant uniqueness

V1 collaboration creation validates the supplied `participants` list before
the driver is added implicitly and before values are converted into the Legacy
management command. Any repeated `actor_id`, regardless of role equality,
returns `invalid_participant`. This removes order-dependent role selection
from downstream `HashSet` deduplication.

### Contract alignment

The POST `/openapi/v1/groups` 409 response declares both `conflict` and
`non_public_participant`, matching the existing V1 error mapping. Contract
tests pin this stable code.

### Second review hardening

The later review pass extends the same compatibility approach:

- Bot registry reads gain a fallible companion used by V1 authorization and
  validation, while Legacy `get` continues returning `Option`.
- Only the V1 creation policy propagates protected-participant friendship
  lookup failures; Legacy reachability keeps its previous behavior.
- First-time Human Principals are materialized with the existing
  `ensure_human_actor` path only when their canonical Actor ID participates in
  a normal Group.
- Participant row decoding and SQLite DM pair-key races fail or retry
  explicitly instead of returning partial Groups or a spurious 500.
- PATCH rejects explicit JSON nulls and delivery-policy updates for non-Chat
  strategies.
- Path extraction failures use the common error envelope, and GET/PATCH
  conflict/error-code declarations cover every stable application error.

### Final review hardening

The final review passes keep the same V1-only compatibility boundary:

- Runtime cleanup uses a SQLite-representable upper bound and enumerates every
  run for each Group session before deleting runtime state.
- HTTP deserialization enforces the OpenAPI `actor_ids.minItems = 1`
  constraint, and V1 quota checks propagate persistent Group lookup failures.
- Runtime configuration reports whether a definition requires a Human input
  ChannelBinding. V1 creation defers the initial run for those definitions,
  because the generated Group ID must exist before a ChannelBinding can be
  provisioned; other StateMachine definitions retain immediate start.
- StateMachine run cancellation happens only after Group deletion and channel
  cleanup can no longer roll the Group back. An idempotent delete retry also
  retries runtime cancellation and state cleanup for an already-missing Group.
- Visibility-guarded participant insertion increments the persisted Group
  version only when the actor is not already a participant, matching the
  in-memory idempotency behavior.
- V1 creation uses fallible registry reads for every requested participant,
  while the Legacy creation policy retains its existing missing-on-error
  compatibility behavior.
- Persistent Group deletion acquires a fallible rollback snapshot before
  issuing DELETE statements, so a snapshot failure cannot be mistaken for a
  successful idempotent no-op or skip committed-delete cleanup.
- PATCH explicitly declares `bot_not_found` when a persisted participant has
  since been soft-deleted from the registry.
- V1 DM delegation preserves fallible caller/target registry reads and
  friendship checks through the Legacy-compatible management layer; the
  Legacy policy keeps its existing missing-or-unreachable fallback behavior.

### Follow-up decision: no V1 Group optimistic lock

The V1 Group update path does not introduce a new version-based optimistic
locking contract. It continues to use the existing field-scoped
`patch_mutable_fields` operation, then reloads the persisted Group for the
response. Storage failures and missing Groups remain distinguishable.

Accordingly:

- V1 update does not capture or pass an `expected_version`.
- Group persistence does not add a version-checked patch operation.
- V1 field patches and visibility-guarded participant insertion do not
  increment `bcs_groups.version`.
- The existing `Group.version` field and pre-existing collaboration/runtime
  concurrency controls remain unchanged.

## Error behavior

- Storage query failures become V1 `internal_error` responses.
- Storage delete failures abort runtime cleanup and become V1
  `internal_error` responses.
- Duplicate participants become `invalid_participant`.
- Protected participants in public group creation continue returning
  `non_public_participant`, now explicitly documented.

## Verification

Each behavior follows a red-green TDD cycle:

- Inject a failing DB plugin for session membership and deletion.
- Inject a failing friendship repository through the real `FriendCore`.
- Exercise duplicate participant creation through `GroupService`.
- Validate the OpenAPI response code set through the contract test.
- Run the affected Session Store, Session, Friend, Group, Runtime, and OpenAPI
  test suites, then the PR CI gates.
